### About Myself:

I started my way into IT with self-study. After some time, 
I decided on the language I want to study and entered 
the GeekBrains online University at the faculty of frontend development.
At the moment I have successfully mastered Git, 
html/css and started learning JS. I have a great desire 
to become a good specialist, so I do not miss opportunities 
to gain additional knowledge in my industry.

### Skills and Proficiency:
* HTML/CSS
* JavaScript Basics
* Git, GitHub
* VS Code
* Adobe Photoshop, Figma, Zeplin
 
==============

Timmy & Sarah think they are in love, but around where they live, 
they will only know once they pick a flower each. If one of the 
flowers has an even number of petals 
and the other has an odd number of petals it means they are in love.

Write a function that will take the number of petals of each flower
and return true if they are in love and false if they aren't.

```
function lovefunc(flower1, flower2){
  return flower1 % 2 !== flower2 % 2;
}
```
